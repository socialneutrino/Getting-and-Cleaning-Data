Coursera Data Science Specialization Course Project

The script in R "run_analysis.R" must be placed in thefolder called "UCI HAR Dataset". Once executed, it will 
create a file called "tidy_data_averages.txt" This contains the tidy data required by the project.

"CODEBOOK.MD" Describes how the data was processed and also the variable names of the tidy data set.
